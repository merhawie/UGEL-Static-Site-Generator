article 6: Determination of Costs  

<ul>
			<li>1 - : All capital expenditure, pre-production costs and revenue expenditure shall be entered in the books of account of the licensee as the actual amount of such expenditure, provided that they arose as a result of a transaction with a person who was not an affiliate.

			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : If the licensee has received a contribution to capital in the form of physical assets, services or expenditure, such contribution shall be valued at the market value of the assets or services on the date they were contributed.  <ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : The value of such assets and services and the amount of such expenditure contributed to capital shall be treated by the licensee as capital expenditure or pre-production costs, as the case may be, and shall be depreciated in accordance with Article 8 of this Proclamation.<ul>
