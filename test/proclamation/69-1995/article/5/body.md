article 5: Determination of Gross Income  
Gross income shall include all revenue actually received from mining operations, provided that such revenue resulted from a transaction with a person who was not an affiliate.  If any revenue was received from an affiliate, the Licensing Authority may adjust such amount to reflect revenue that would have been received based on market prices for a similar transaction carried out at the time at arms-length or shall use such other provisions as may be determined by agreement.
