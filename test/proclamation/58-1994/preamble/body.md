<ul>
			<li> - : Whereas the systems of land tenure and use, and the concomitant laws and traditions existing in Eritrea have been rendered obsolete and incompatible with the contemporary demands of the country;<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li> - : Whereas consequent to the obsolete system of land tenure and land laws:<ul>
						<li> - : the programs of reconstruction and development are getting on the verge of becoming non-functional;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li> - : land disputes and frictions are increasing from time to time;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li> - : our country’s land is being eroded, its productivity is being diminished, forests are being destroyed, and the country’s agricultural resource is generally devitalized; <ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li> - : Whereas the existing land tenure system in our country can not accommodate our increasing population growth, can not provide opportunities for improved and modern systems of land-use, and impedes raising the living standard of our village population;<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li> - : Whereas in order for the Eritrean land tenure system to meet contemporary demands and pave way for the progress of our country’s socio-economic situation, it should:<ul>
						<li> - : assure agricultural and industrial development;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li> - : promote or assure initiative and motivation among beneficiaries and producers;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li> - : encourage private investment and initiative;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li> - : avoid contradiction, friction, and dispute;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li> - : pave way for the improvement of the living standard of the people of Eritrea;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li> - : be standard and applicable throughout the nation; and<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li> - : Whereas these objectives can only be attained by replacing the existing progress-impeding system of land tenure in Eritrea by a new and dynamic system;<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li> - : Now, therefore, the Government of Eritrea has promulgated a Proclamation aimed at reforming the system of land tenure in Eritrea, determining land use, determining the manner of expropriating land to be utilized for development and national reconstruction, and determining the powers and responsibilities of the Land Commission.<ul>
