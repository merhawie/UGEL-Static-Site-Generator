article 16: Cancellation of residence permit
If the conditions for which a residence permit has been granted have come to an end or are suspended the permit will be cancelled. But if other conditions arise to justify the granting of residence permit or if there are new grounds which the Secretary accepts as valid the previous residence permit may be continued.
