article 50: Distribution of Hours of Work in Weeks
Where the circumstances in which the work has to be carried on are such that normal hours of work cannot be distributed evenly over a week, working hours calculated on the basis of average hours of work may be distributed over a period longer than one week, provided that the average number of hours worked over a four-week or shorter period may not exceed eight hours per day and forty eight hours per week.
