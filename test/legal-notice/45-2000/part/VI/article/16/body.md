article 16: Report of Commercial Discovery and Development Plan
In the event that a Discovery of Petroleum is made in a contract area which the Contractor considers to be commercial, the Contractor shall, prior to the commencement of development and production operations, submit to the Minister the following:
<ul>
			<li>a - : a description and map of the area containing such Discovery which the Contractor proposes to delineate as a Field defined by reference to the UTM grid;<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>b - : a detailed report accompanied by supporting data and all analyses and interpretations thereof, which demonstrates that the area described in paragraph (a) above contains, alone or in conjunction with other areas, as the case may be, a Commercial Discovery; the report required by this paragraph shall be accompanied by a report on the Discovery, setting forth all relevant technical and economic data, including, but not limited to, geological, geochemical and geophysical information, areas, thickness and extent of the productive strata, petrophysical properties of the reservoir formations, PVT data, the reservoir&#39;s productivity indices for the Wells tested at various rates of flow, permeability and porosity of the reservoir formation, the relevant characteristics and qualities of the Petroleum discovered, additional geological data and evaluations of the reservoir, Crude Oil and Natural Gas reserves estimates, and any other relevant characteristics and properties of the reservoirs and fluids contained therein, as well as all evaluations, interpretations and analyses of such data, and feasibility studies relating to the Discovery, prepared by or for the Contractor, with respect to the Discovery;<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>c - : a work program and work program budget for the development of such Discovery. Such development work program and work program budget shall set out detailed proposals, including cost estimates, Drilling schedules, number and types of Wells and Well spacing, amount of reserves to be developed, production forecasts and a timing schedule, in accordance with generally accepted engineering practices and economics of the international petroleum industry for the establishment and operation of all the facilities, installations and services required for the production, processing, storage and transportation of Petroleum from the area in which the Discovery is located, and any other activities incidental thereto. The overall safety objectives as well as the general safety arrangements shall be described. Proposals relating to production procedures shall ensure that the area does not suffer an excessive rate of decline of production, or an excessive loss of reservoir pressure, and shall ensure environmental protection conforming to generally accepted practices in the petroleum industry and these Regulations. Such development work program and work program budget shall also contain particulars of feasible alternatives, if any, considered by the Contractor for the development and exploitation of the Discovery, and economic feasibility studies carried out by or for the Contractor with respect to the Discovery, taking into account the location, meteorological conditions, cost estimates, the forecast price of Petroleum, and any other relevant data and evaluations thereof;<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>d - : full information as to the Contractor&#39;s current financial status, technical competence and experience;<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>e - : detailed proposals for the design, construction, establishment and operation of all facilities (including their location) for and incidental to the planning, development, extraction (including plans for injection), production, processing, metering, storage, transportation (including the routing of any proposed pipeline), sale and other disposal of Petroleum, and a proposed time table for the commencement of Petroleum production;<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>f - : a detailed forecast of capital investment requirements, operating costs and sales revenues and the anticipated type and source of financing;<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>g - : proposals relating to necessary infrastructure investments, training and employment of Eritrean nationals, and plans to maximize the use of Eritrean materials, products and services ; and<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>h - : such other matters as may be required under the Contract or as the Minister may reasonably require.<ul>
			</ul></li></ul>
