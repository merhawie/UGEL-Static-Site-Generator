									</ul></li>						</ul></li>						<li>d - : such other data as the Minister may, by written notice to the Contractor, reasonably require him to so submit.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : Originals of records, magnetic tapes and other data can be exported by Contractors upon prior notification to the Minister, provided, however, that magnetic tapes and any other data which must be processed or analyzed outside of Eritrea may be exported if a comparable record is maintained in Eritrea and provided that such exported originals of records, tapes and data shall be repatriated to Eritrea within a reasonable time. Ownership of all original data shall vest in the State when such data is acquired.<ul>
