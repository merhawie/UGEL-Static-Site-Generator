article 21: Hygienic conditions for canned fishery products

<ul>
			<li>1 - : A scheduled process shall be established by experienced personnel for low acid foods in hermetically sealed containers. A &quot;Standard Operating Procedure&quot; Manual shall be compiled specifying the:<ul>
						<li>a - : Establishment of the thermal process with:<ul>
									<li>i - : heat penetration.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>ii - : heat distribution study.<ul>
									</ul></li>						</ul></li>						<li>b - : Process control system with:<ul>
									<li>i - : equipment description.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>ii - : monitoring system.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>iii - : general operations in the thermal processing room.<ul>
									</ul></li>						</ul></li>						<li>c - : Container integrity checks:<ul>
									<li>i - : incoming containers.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>ii - : seaming machines.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>iii - : evaluation of double seam integrity.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>iv - : monitoring of cooling water.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>v - : cooling of containers.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>vi - : post-process handling of containers.<ul>
									</ul></li>						</ul></li>						<li>d - : documentation and records:<ul>
									<li>i - : processing and production records.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>ii - : management review of records.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>iii - : process deviation records<ul>
									</ul></li>						</ul></li>						<li> - : and shall be approved by the Competent Authority. The Standard Operating Procedures Manual shall be based on the requirements laid down in Title 21 Food and Drugs, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, Part 113, Thermally Processed Low-acid Foods Packaged in Hermetically Sealed Containers (21 CFR p-113).<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : The canning conditions shall comply with the following requirements:<ul>
						<li>a - : the water used for canning shall be potable;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : the heat treatment process shall be appropriate with respect to the heating time, temperature, filling, and size of containers, etc., a record of which shall be kept;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : the heat treatment shall be capable of destroying or inactivating pathogenic organisms and their spores;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>d - : the autoclave shall be fitted with devices for verifying whether the containers have undergone appropriate time-temperature treatments; and<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>e - : potable water shall be used to cool containers after heat treatment, without prejudice to the presence of any chemical additives used in accordance with good technological practice to prevent corrosion of the equipment and containers.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : Following checks shall be carried out to verify the canning process:<ul>
						<li>a - : further checks shall be carried out at random by the manufacturer to ensure that the processed products have undergone appropriate heat treatment, this include:<ul>
									<li>i - : incubation test at 37&quot; C for seven days or at 35&quot; C far ten days or at any other equivalent combination shall be carried out; and<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>ii - : microbiological examination of the contents shall be done at the establishment&#39;s laboratory or in any other approved laboratory.<ul>
									</ul></li>						</ul></li>						<li>b - : Samples shall be taken from production every day at predetermined intends, to ensure the efficiency of sealing or of any other method of hermetic closure. For that purpose, appropriate equipment shall be available for the examination of cross-sections of the can-seams.<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : Checks shall be carried out in order to ensure that containers are not damaged.<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>d - : All containers that have undergone heat treatment under practically identical conditions during the same period of time shall be given a batch identification mark.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li></ul>
