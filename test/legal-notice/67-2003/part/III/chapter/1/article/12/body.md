article 12: Conditions of hygiene for fresh products

<ul>
			<li>1 - : The chilling of fishery products shall be carried out under the following conditions:<ul>
						<li>a - : quick chilling of fishery products is necessary to prevent undesirable physical, chemical and microbiological deterioration;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : at the end of the chilling cycle, the temperature of fishery products shall reach the temperature of melting ice, i.e., OoC with a tolerance of +- 1‚Äù C; and<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : for Scombroid and related species of fish, in order to control histamine formation, their internal temperature shall be brought from ambient temperature to 10&quot; C or below within 6 hours, and once chilled shall be maintained as close to the temperature of melting ice as possible. After chilling, during preparation or processing, the fishery products shall not be exposed to temperatures above 4&quot; for a cumulative period of more than 2 hours.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : Chill storage rooms shall comply with the following requirements:<ul>
						<li>a - : establishments preparing fresh fish as a find product shall have separate chilled stores for raw material and finished products;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : a chilled room used to store fresh fish shall operate at a temperature of melting ice;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : a chilled storage room shall not be used for initial freezing of fish or fishery products; and<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>d - : chilled rooms shall be kept clean and free from accumulation of ice. The floor and general structure of the room should be kept in a good condition.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : The chilling of unpacked fishery products shall be carried out under the following conditions:<ul>
						<li>a - : where chilled unpacked fishery products (raw material) are not dispatched, prepared or processed immediately after reaching the establishment, they shall be stored under ice in the establishment&#39;s chill storage room. Re-icing shall be carried out as often as is necessary; and<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : the ice used, with or without salt, shall be made from potable water or clean sea water and be hygienically stored in clean and well maintained containers provided for that purpose.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>4 - : Fresh products shall be packed in ice or a similar temperature condition shall be created by mechanical refrigeration.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>5 - : The preparation of fishery products shall be carried out in compliance with the following requirements:<ul>
						<li>a - : operations such as heading and gutting shall be carried out hygienically and the products shall be washed thoroughly with potable water or clean seawater immediately after such operations;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : the quantities of fish on the worktables at any one time shall be kept to a minimum;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : fish, which is held on the tables awaiting preparation, shall be protected by adequate quantities of ice. Tables provide a good heat transfer medium, therefore, the fish shall rest on a layer of ice and also be covered with it;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>d - : when the workers break off, there shall not be any fish left on the tables;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>e - : the internal temperature of the fishery products during handling and preparation on the worktables shall be maintained below a limit designed by the management and approved by the Competent Authority;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>f - : all equipment used for the filleting of fish shall be washed and disinfected regularly during the process. This applies to hives, cutting boards, tables, etc;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>g - : fillets shall be rinsed immediately after filleting and prior to subsequent packing;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>h - : all fish handlers shall wash and disinfect their hands properly or wear clean gloves before commencing their work;<ul>
									<li>i - : if the fillets are not immediately packed or frozen they shall be stored at 0&quot; C with adequate quantities of ice, or in a chill store; and<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>ii - : containers used for the dispatch or storage of fresh fishery products shall protect and preserve the products under sufficiently hygienic conditions and shall allow drainage of melt water.<ul>
									</ul></li>						</ul></li>			</ul></li></ul>
