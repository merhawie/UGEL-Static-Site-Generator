article 13: Conditions of hygiene for frozen products

<ul>
			<li>1 - : Freezing of fishery products shall be carried out under the following conditions:<ul>
						<li>a - : establishments shall have freezing equipment such as the blast&#x2F;contact&#x2F;plate&#x2F;tunnel or brine freezers that are sufficiently powerful to achieve a rapid reduction of the fish temperature so that the core temperature laid down in these Regulations can be obtained as fast as possible;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : fresh products to be frozen or quick-frozen shall comply with the requirements, conditions and procedures for fresh products laid down in Article 12 hereof; and<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : the freezing process shall be carried out in such a way that it minimizes undesirable chemical and microbiological changes. Therefore:<ul>
									<li>i - : fish shall be frozen in a room or chamber specifically designed for the purpose and it should be clean and free from accumulation of frost;<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>ii - : blocks of fish or fish products for freezing shall not have a maximum thickness of more than 80 mm;<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>iii - : if the fish is not to be packed and frozen immediately, it shall be stored with sufficient ice to maintain its temperature at 0‚Äù C or in a chill store at that temperature;<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>iv - : any glaze water that is added to the fish shall first be chilled to 0&quot; C. It is recommended that a mixture of ice and potable water be used;<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>v - : during off-loading of the freezer, the core temperature of the fish shall not rise above -18&quot; C and the fish shall be packed in a chamber held at 0&quot; C or less; and<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>vi - : packing in a master carton shall be done rapidly to prevent the temperature of fish from rising above - 18&quot; C.<ul>
									</ul></li>						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : When freezing fishery products, the management shall take into account the freezing capacity of the facilities:<ul>
						<li>a - : freezing chambers or other freezing equipment, shall reduce the temperature of a product through the zone of maximum crystallization (in most products -l&quot; C to -5&quot; C) preferably within 4 hours but not exceeding 6 hours from the start of the refrigeration process;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : where the refrigeration process is continued in order to reduce the thermal core temperature to -18&quot; C or colder, the whole refrigeration process should be preferably completed within 8 hours, but not exceeding 12 hours. Inadequate freezing facilities lead to longer freezing times that damages the texture and quality of the fishery products;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : the freezing process is completed only when the thermal core temperature reaches -18&quot; C after thermal stabilization. Brine frozen fish for canning use that may be frozen at higher temperature, although not exceeding -9&quot; C, is an exception; and<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>d - : any blast freezer should not be overloaded with quantities in excess of the design capacity. Reference should be made to the specifications of the supplier of the refrigeration equipment in order to determine the recommended capacity, but generally loading should not exceed 70 % of the internal volume.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : To keep fishery products in a frozen condition, cold storage rooms and the storage conditions shall comply with the following requirements:<ul>
						<li>a - : the floor and general structure of the cold storage rooms shall be kept in a good condition;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : all cold storage rooms shall be kept clean and free from accumulation of frost;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : the cold storage room shall be well organized; different products and batches should be physically separated;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>d - : in order to permit the free circulation of air within the cold storage, products shall not be stored in contact with the walls or floor. The use of platting and racking system is recommended;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>e - : poultry, meat and other products that may contaminate the fishery products shall not be stored in the cold store unless the product is packaged and physically separated from the seafood product;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>f - : to keep cardboard boxes clean, they shall not be placed on the floor;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>g - : the principle of first in and first out shall be implemented in the storage of fishery products;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>h - : temperature fluctuations shall be minimum after the freezing process and during handling and transport;<ul>
									<li>i - : cold storage rooms shall have temperature-recording devices in a place where it can easily be read. The temperature sensor of the recorder shall be located in an area furthest away from the cold source, i.e. where the temperature in the storage room is the highest; and<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>ii - : temperature charts shall be available for inspection by the supervisory authorities at least during the period in which the products are stored.<ul>
									</ul></li>						</ul></li>			</ul></li></ul>
