article 14: Monitoring

<ul>
			<li>1 - : The Competent Authority should take all the necessary measures to ensure that regular monitoring of water quality is carried out in order to check whether the water available meets the requirements of these
Regulations and in particular the chemical parametric values set in accordance with Article 5 hereof.
Samples should be taken so that they are representative of the quality of the water used throughout the year. In addition to these, where disinfection and the use of certain substances or materials forms part of the preparation or distribution of the water, the Competent Authority shall take all the necessary measures that:<ul>
						<li>a - : the efficiency of the disinfection applied is ensured;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : the use of the substances is governed; and<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : any contamination from by-products of disinfection is kept to a minimum without compromising the disinfection in order to avoid harmful effects to human health.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : In-order to meet the obligations imposed in sub-article 1 hereof, appropriate monitoring programmes shall be installed. These monitoring programmes shall meet the minimum requirements set out in Annex II hereof.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : Without prejudice to the requirements for the frequency of sampling set out in Table B of Annex I1 hereof:<ul>
						<li>a - : the frequency of water sampled for the purpose of check monitoring in an establishment:<ul>
									<li>i - : in the case of water supplied from a public distribution network without intermediary storage, shall be at least once per three months from various representative outlets within the plant as laid down in Annex IV hereof.<ul>
									</ul></li>									<li>ii - : In the case of water supplied from a public distribution network intermediary storage or from a town water source, shall be at least once per month from various representative outlets within the plant as laid down in Annex IV hereof.<ul>
									</ul></li>						</ul></li>						<li>b - : the frequency of water sampled for the purpose of audit monitoring in an establishment shall be at least once per year; and<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : the frequency of the routine water sampling, in connection with the auto-control system or own checks established under the quality assurance programme installed in the establishments, shall be left to the decision &#39;of the quality management team in consultation with the Competent Authority.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>4 - : The sampling points shall be determined by the Competent Authority and shall meet the relevant requirements set out in Annex II hereof.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>5 - : <ul>
						<li>a - : The Competent Authority shall comply with the specifications for the analyses of parameters set out in Annex III hereof.<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : Methods other than those specified in Annex III of Part 1 hereof may be used provided that the results obtained are at least as reliable as those obtained by the methods specified. The Competent Authority that has recourse to alternative methods shall provide all the relevant information concerning such methods and their equivalence.<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : For those parameters listed in Annex III of Parts 2 and 3 hereof, any method of analysis may be used provided that it meets the requirements set out therein.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>6 - : If there is a reason to suspect that they may be present in amounts or numbers which constitute a potential danger to human health, the Competent Authority shall ensure that additional monitoring is carried out on a case-by-case basis of substances and micro-organisms for which no parametric value has been set in accordance with Article 5 hereof.<ul>
