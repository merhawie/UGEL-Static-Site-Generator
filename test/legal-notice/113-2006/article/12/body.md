article 12: Milk composition standards

<ul>
			<li>1 - : Any plant should comply with the following standards:<ul>
						<li>a - : Ensuring that butter fat content of the raw milk is 3.3% or above.<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>b - : Unless it is clearly indicated that the milk is low fat milk, butter fat content of normal pasteurized milk must be 3%.<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>c - : Ensuring that pH of normal milk must vary from 6.5 – 6.7 in an ambient temperature of 25° C.<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>d - : Density or specific gravity, in a lactometer reading, of raw milk must be a minimum of 1.026 and may reach up to 1.038 gram in 1 m3.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : Raw milk that is supplied to a plant shall be discarded and immediately dumped under one of the following conditions:<ul>
						<li>a - : where any foreign material (skimmed milk or dirt) is added or when any of its natural components are missing; or<ul>

						</ul></li>						<li>f - : whenever it is contaminated by bio-organisms or contains unusual number of somatic cells; or<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li>g - : whenever its density test in a lactometer reading is lower than 1.026.<ul>
