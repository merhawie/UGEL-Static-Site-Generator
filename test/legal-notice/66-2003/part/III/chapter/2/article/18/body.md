article 18: Number of incremental samples

<ul>
			<li>1 - : In the case of liquid products for which a homogeneous distribution of the contaminant in question can be assumed within a given lot, it is sufficient to take one incremental sample per lot which forms the aggregate sample. The sample collected should be given a reference to the lot number. The liquid product shall be shaken or homogenized by other suitable means before the incremental sample is taken.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : For other products, the minimum number of incremental samples to be taken from the lot shall be as given in Table 1 below. The incremental samples shall be of similar weight. Departure from this procedure must be recorded in the record provided for under Art. 17 hereof.<ul>
						<li> - : &lt;&lt;table 1&gt;&gt;<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : If the lot consists of individual packages, then the number of packages that shall be taken to form the aggregate sample is given in Table 2 below.<ul>
						<li> - : &lt;&lt;table 2&gt;&gt;<ul>
