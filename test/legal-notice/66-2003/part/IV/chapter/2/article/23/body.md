article 23: Definitions
A number of the most commonly used definitions that are used by the laboratory to establish procedures for sample preparation and criteria for methods of analysis are given below:
<ul>
			<li>a - r: Repeatability: the value below which the absolute difference between two single test results obtained under repeatability conditions (i.e., same sample, same operator, same apparatus, same laboratory, and short: interval of time) may be expected to lie within a specific probability (typically 95%) and hence r &#x3D; 2.8 X Sr.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>b - Sr: Standard deviation: calculated from results generated under repeatability conditions.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>c - RSDr: Relative standard deviation: calculated from results generated under repeatability conditions [(Sr &#x2F; x~ ) X 100], where x~ is the average of results over all laboratories and samples.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>d - R: Reproducability: the value below which the absolute difference between single test results obtained under reproducibility conditions (i.e., on identical material obtained by operators in different laboratories, using the standardized test method), may be expected to lie within a certain probability (typically 95 %); R &#x3D; 2.8 x SR.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>e - SR: Standard deviation: calculated from results under reproducibility conditions.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>f - RSDR: Relative standard deviation: calculated from results generated under reproducibility conditions [(SR &#x2F; x~) X 100]<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>g - HORRATr: The observed RSD, divided by the RSDr value estimated from the Horwitz equation using the assumption r &#x3D; 0.66R<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>h - HORRATR: The observed RSDR value divided by the RSDR value calculated from the Horwitz equation (a).<ul>
			</ul></li></ul>
