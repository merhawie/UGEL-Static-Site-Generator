article 9: Methods for identification of critical points
The identification of critical point for the control of a hazard requires a logical approach. Such an approach can be facilitated by the use of the following decision tree (other methods can be used by the team, according to their knowledge and experience).
<ul>
			<li>1 - : Decision tree for the identification of critical points answer each question in sequence, at each step and for each identified hazard.
<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : For the application of the decision tree, each process step identified in the flow diagram should be considered in sequence. At each step, the decision tree must be applied to each hazard that may be reasonably expected to occur Dr be introduced and each control measure identified<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : Application of the decision tree should be flexible and requires common sense, having consideration for the whole manufacturing process in order to avoid, whenever possible, unnecessary critical points.<ul>
