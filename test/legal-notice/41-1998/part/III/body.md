part III: RECOMMENDATION FOR PROCEEDING WITH ACTIVITIES IN SEQUENCE REGARDING IDENTIFICATION OF CRITICAL POINTS

<ul>
			<li>3 - Assembly of a multidisciplinary team: <ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>4 - Description of the product: The end product should be described in terms of:<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>5 - Identification of intended use: The multidisciplinary team should also define the normal or expected use of the product by the customer and the consumer target groups for which the product is intended. In specific cases, the suitability of the product for particular groups of consumers such as institutional caterers, travelers etc and for vulnerable groups of the population may have to be considered.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>6 - Construction of a flow diagram (Description of manufacturing process): <ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>7 - On-site confirmation of flow diagram: After the flow diagram has been drawn up, the multidisciplinary team should confirm it on site during operating hours. Any observed deviation must result in an amendment of the original flow diagram to make it accurate.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>8 - Listing of hazards and control measures: Using the confirmed flow diagram as a guide the team should:<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>9 - Methods for identification of critical points: The identification of critical point for the control of a hazard requires a logical approach. Such an approach can be facilitated by the use of the following decision tree (other methods can be used by the team, according to their knowledge and experience).<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>10 - Action to be taken following identification of a critical point: The identification of critical control points has two consequences for the multidisciplinary team, which should then:<ul>
