article 14: Own-checks system
Own-checks system verification is necessary to ensure that they are working effectively. The multidisciplinary team should specify the methods and procedures to used:
<ul>
			<li>1 - : Usable methods may include in particular random sampling and analysis, reinforced analysis or tests at selected critical points, intensified analysis of intermediate or final products, surveys on actual condition during storage, distribution and sale and on actual use of the product.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : Verification procedures may include: inspection of operations, validation of critical limits, review of deviations, corrective action and measures taken with regard to the product, audits of the own-check system and its records.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : Verification should provide for confirmation of the suitability of the own-checks system established and ensure, afterwards, with an appropriate frequency, that the provisions laid down are still being properly applied.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>4 - : In addition, it is necessary to review the system, to ensure that it is (or will be) still valid in case of change. Examples of change include:<ul>
						<li> - : change in raw material or in product, processing conditions (factory layout and environment, process equipment, cleaning and disinfection program);<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li> - : change in packaging, storage or distribution conditions;<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li> - : change in consumer use; and<ul>
						</ul></li>						<li> - : receipt of any information on a new hazard associated with the product.<ul>
						</ul></li>			</ul></li>			<li>5 - : When necessary, such a review must result in the amendment of the provision laid laid down.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>6 - : Any change to the own-checks system arising should be fully incorporated into the documentation and record-keeping system in order to ensure that accurate up-to-date information is available.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>7 - : Where criteria are specified in regulations, such criteria are to be used as reference values for the verification process.<ul>
