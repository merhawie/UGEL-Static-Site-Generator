article 11: Establishment of critical limits for each control measures associated with each critical point

<ul>
			<li>1 - : Each control measure associated with critical control points should give rise to the specification of critical limits.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : Those critical limits correspond to the extreme values acceptable with regard to product safety. They separate acceptability from unacceptability. They are set for observable or measurable parameters that can readily demonstrate that the critical point is under control, they should be based on substantiated evidence that chosen values will result in process control.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : Examples of such parameters include temperature, time, pH, moisture level, additive, preservative or salt level, sensory parameters such as visual appearance or texture ... etc.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>4 - : In some cases, to reduce the risk of exceeding a critical limit due to process variations, it may be necessary to specify more stringent levels (ie target levels) to assure that critical limits are observed.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>5 - : Critical limits may be derived from a variety of sources. When not taken from regulatory standards (eg frozen storage temperature) or from existing and validated guides of good manufacturing practices, the team should ascertain their validity relative to the control of identified hazard and critical points.<ul>
