article 12: Establishment of a monitoring and checking system for each critical point

<ul>
			<li>1 - : An essential part of own-checks is a program of observations or measurements performed at each critical point to ensure compliance with specified critical limits. The program should describe the methods, the frequency of observations or measurements and the recording procedure.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>2 - : Observations or measurements must be able to detect loss of control at critical points and provide information in time for corrective action to be taken.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>3 - : Observations or measurements can be made continuously or discontinuously when observations or measurements are not continuous, it is necessary to establish a frequency of observations or measurements, which provides reliable information.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>4 - : The program of observations or measurements should properly identify for each critical point:
-who is to perform monitoring and checking;
-when monitoring and checking is performed; and
-how monitoring and checking is performed.<ul>
