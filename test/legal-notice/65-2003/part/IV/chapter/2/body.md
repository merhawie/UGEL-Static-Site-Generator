chapter 2: METHOD OF ANALYSIS TO BE USED BY THE LABORATORY AND LABORATORY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS

<ul>
			<li>23 - Definitions: A number of the most commonly used definitions that are used by the laboratory to establish procedures for sample preparation and criteria for methods of analysis are given below:<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>24 - General requirements: Reliable and scientifically recognized methods of analysis should be used for food control purposes.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>25 - Specific requirements for lead, cadmium and mercury analysis: Specific methods for the determination of lead, cadmium and mercury contents are not prescribed. Nevertheless, reference methods for detecting heavy metals are laid down (c), inter alias, Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS). Laboratories shall use a validated method that fulfils the performance criteria indicated in Table 3 below. Where possible, the validation shall include a certified reference material in the collaborative trial test materials. Table 3: Performance criteria of methods for lead, cadmium and mercury analysis. 
<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>26 - Estimation of the analytical trueness and recovery calculations: Whenever possible, the trueness of the analysis shall be estimated by including suitable certified reference materials in the analytical run. The “Harmonised Guidelines for the Use of Recovery Information in Analytical Measurement” (d) developed under the auspices of IUPAC&#x2F;ISO&#x2F;AOAC shall be taken into account. The analytical result shall be reported either corrected or uncorrected. The manner of reporting and the level of recovery must be reported.<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>27 - Laboratory quality standards: Laboratories must have implemented the Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) (C).<ul>
			</ul></li>			<li>28 - Expression of results: The results shall be expressed in the same unit as the maximum levels laid down in Articles 4, 5 and 6 hereof, that is in ppm (mg&#x2F;kg).<ul>
