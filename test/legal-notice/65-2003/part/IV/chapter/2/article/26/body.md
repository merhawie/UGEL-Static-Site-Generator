article 26: Estimation of the analytical trueness and recovery calculations
Whenever possible, the trueness of the analysis shall be estimated by including suitable certified reference materials in the analytical run. The “Harmonised Guidelines for the Use of Recovery Information in Analytical Measurement” (d) developed under the auspices of IUPAC&#x2F;ISO&#x2F;AOAC shall be taken into account. The analytical result shall be reported either corrected or uncorrected. The manner of reporting and the level of recovery must be reported.
