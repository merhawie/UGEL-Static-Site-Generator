article 14: 
If the amount of rent paid to the lessor or sub-lessor covers a period longer than one (1) year, the total amount of income from such rent shall be attributable to the fiscal year in which the payment was made, but the tax on such income payable for said fiscal year shall be computed by prorating the taxable income over the number of years covered by the amount paid.
