article 10: 
If the Inland Revenue Department has reason to consider that the total amount of salaries and other personal emoluments payable to the manager or managers of a partnership or a private limited company is exaggerated, it may reduce said amount for taxation purposes to the limit which in view of the operations of the partnership or the private limited company, appears justifiable, either by disallowing the payments made to more than one manager or in any other way which may be just and appropriate.
